## How does it works

Level 1. Feasibility Check (MVP?) archt
1. Download image
2. Feed it to AI(GPT4o, Gemini)
  - Prompt Engeering(system prompt)
3. Customize the code
*Still meaningful as working with ai

Level 2. Automation (Git branch practice)
1. Give the link
2. AI creates the code
  - LangChain, LLaMA Index
3. AI evaluates the code
4. AI customize the code base on the template
  - input, output, text, color, title, ...
5. 

Level 3. Packing (MVP?) advanced features
Streamlit, Gradio
